			<h2>The ESSA Era: Ch-Ch-Changes</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>ESSA has given states increased flexibility in creating accountability systems.</li>
					<li class="next">Most states now include student growth in their accountability systems.</li>
					<li class="next">Even those states with experience using calculating growth encounter challenges when transitioning between assessments/standards.</li>

			<h2>Ch-Ch-Changes & Growth</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Assessment/Standards transition can impact growth calculations, sometimes in significant ways.</li>
					<li class="next">Some states have transitioned assessments 3 times in the last several years.</li>
					<li class="next">In most cases these states have also transitioned standards at least once.</li>
					<li class="next">In many cases states allow dual mode administration (P&P or Online).</li>

		<section class="slide" id="Vertical-Scale">
			<h2>Vertical Scales</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Some states have transitioned from assessments without a vertical-scale to assessments with vertical-scales (e.g., many SBAC states)</li>
					<li class="next">Some states have transitioned from assessments with a vertical scale to assessments without a vertical scale.</li>
					<li class="next">Some states have never had a vertical scale.</li>
					<li class="next">As should be apparent, you don't need a vertical scale to calculate some form of student growth.</li>
				</ul>
				<style>
				#Vertical-Scale {

				</style>
		</section>


	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Vertical-Scale">
			<h2>Vertical Scales</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Despite not needing a vertical scale, some states use their vertical scale for growth calculations</li>
					<li class="next">A vertical scale allows for subtraction which is intuitive to users.</li>
					<li class="next">Depending upon how the scale is used, it can be critical that the scale be strongly equated from year-to-year.</li>
					<li class="next">If difference scores are calculated for students, consistent interpretation from year-to-year requires strong equating.</li>
				</ul>
				<style>
				#Vertical-Scale {
					font: 30px Avenir;
				}
				</style>
		</section>


	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Norm-Growth">
			<h2>Norm-Referenced Growth</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Most states do some form of norm-referenced growth (SGP or VAM) even if they have a vertical-scale.</li>
					<li class="next">Norm-referenced growth is very forgiving with regard to assessment transitions.</li>
					<li class="next">As long as students take the same assessment in any given year, we can norm their progress.</li>
					<li class="next">However, norms by their nature are limited to stating where one is in a larger distribution.</li>
				</ul>
				<style>
				#Norm-Growth {

				</style>
		</section>


	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Criterion-Growth">
			<h2>Criterion-Referenced Growth</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Several states have shown interest in supplementing their norm-referenced analyses with growth-to-proficiency (criterion-referenced) growth.</li>
					<li class="next">Growth-to-standard is particularly prominent in English Language Proficiency testing.</li>
					<li class="next">Growth-to-standard calculation requires at least two years of data on the same scale.</li>
					<li class="next">To perform growth-to-standard across an assessment transition, some states put the old test scores on the new scale and move forward
						as though they have two years of data.</li>
					<li class="next">Transitioning to new standards doesn't impede growth-to-standard but will result in more difficult/lenient targets depending upon
						whether the standards are more difficult or lenient.</li>

				#Criterion-Growth {

		</section>


	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Value-Tables">
			<h2>Value tables</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Value-tables, which use the states prior and current performance levels to cross-tabulate student growth and award points based upon the transition observed.</li>
					<li class="next">In an of themself, a value-table is neither norm- or criterion-referenced. Similar to gain scores.</li>
					<li class="next">Use of value-tables requires the performance levels to mean the same thing from year to year.</li>
					<li class="next">Assessment or standards transition require resetting values in the value-table.</li>
				</ul>
				<style>
				#Value-Tables {
					font: 30px Avenir;
				}
				</style>
		</section>


	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Mode-Effects">
			<h2>Mode Effects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Many states, transition to online assessments, have allowed dual mode administration.</li>
					<li class="next">Often obscured in status results, growth is a magnifying glass that shows these differences.</li>
					<li class="next">Unless explicity adjusted for, on every assessment and in every state I've seen significant mode effects -- large enough to impact growth results used for accountability.</li>
				</ul>
				<style>
				#Mode-Effects {

	<!-- Slide -->
		<section class="slide" id="Ceiling-Effects">
			<h2>Ceiling/Floor Effects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Tests with significant ceilings/floors can impact some growth analyses.</li>
					<li class="next">Students at the HOSS/LOSS will receive inaccurate growth scores</li>
					<li class="next">These results, when aggregated, can change summary scores used for accountability ratings.</li>

		<section class="slide" id="Due-Dilligence">
			<h2>Due-Dilligence</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Investigate correlations between growth and prior-achievement at both the individual and summary level. Make sure the results make sense.</li>
					<li class="next">Investigate summary growth results for specific demographic subgroups or school types. Make sure the results make sense.</li>
					<li class="next">If allowing dual-mode administration, look at growth results associated with each testing mode. Make sure there are only minor differences.</li>
					<li class="next">If using growth-to-standard, calculate summary results and make sure the results conform to your vision for the accountability system.</li>
					<li class="next">Look at growth associated with lowest and highest performers (prior score) and make sure growth scores are accurate.</li>
